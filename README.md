# Kaggle heart failure dataset

This project applies 4 machine learning algorithms to the heart failure clinical records dataset from kaggle and aims to predict whether a patient will die from heart failure or not.

## The branches:

* master - contains basic info on the project and the results pdf of the whole project.
* NN - contains the neural network implementation to predict a patients heart failure risk.
* Naive-Bayes - contains the naive-bayes implementation to predict a patients heart failure risk.
* decisionTree - contains the decision tree implementation to predict a patients heart failure risk.
* logistic- contains the logistic regression implementation to predict a patients heart failure risk.
